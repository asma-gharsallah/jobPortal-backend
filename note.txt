backend model == > exp : number 
jobs in database

front : one input(type number) for experience instead of 2

joblist => filter for regular user (non admin) to show only active jobs (controller server side)



-----------------
1- application model => remove resume

2- notes???

    answer:
    Fundamental Difference Between coverLetter and notes
    *coverLetter:
        - Written by the applicant when submitting their application.
        - Contains a general or tailored message explaining why they are a good fit for the position.
    
    *notes:
        Written by recruiters or hiring team members during the evaluation process.
        Used for adding internal comments, observations, or specific remarks about the application as it progresses.
        Acts as an internal communication tool among the HR or recruitment team.

3- /api/job/:id/apply controller



------
split dashboard into two components:

dashboard user: if application is ["pending", "under_review", "accepted", "rejected"] we show it, if application 
is "withdrawn" we remove it from the list

dashboard admin : the list should show by default ["pending", "under_review"] applications
we add filters above the list to include ["accepted","rejected", "withdrawn"] applications

final step: add pagination (low priority)


seperate resume field from user model
create model for resumes
relationships:
user has many resumes
resume belongs to one user


bug: cv being deleted in applications if its changed from user profile
bug: update profile
